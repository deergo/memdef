Boolean
a subset of algebra used for creating true/false statements
AND gate
a Boolean operator which gives the value one if and only if all the operands are one, and otherwise has a value of zero
OR gate
a logical operation which gives the value one if at least one operand has the value one, and otherwise gives a value of zero.
NOT gate
a Boolean operator with only one variable that has the value one when the variable is zero and vice versa.
Truth table
Show the result of combining any two expression boolean expressions using the AND operator and the OR operator (or the NOT operator).
Flashing the firmware
updating/overwriting the firmware or data on ROM
BIOS
basic input output system, is stored on ROM so that the computer has boot-up instructions when the power is turned on.
Hexadecimal

For users who are unable to communicate verbally, this will take text they type on the computer and then relay those words through speakers, using a variety of synthesised voices.
Braille keyboard
Used by people with poor or no sight in order to type text into a computer. The keys are embossed with the standard Braille character patterns.
Foot mouse
Replicates the functions of a normal mouse but made for people with limited use of hand movement. A trackball and buttons are designed to be easily operated by a foot.

3 Components of a CPU
Control Unit, Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), registers
Binary
Number system in base 2 that computers use to represent data and instructions
ROM
Type of non-volatile memory that holds crucial information such as the boot program. Permanent
RAM
Acts as a temporary store of data and program instructions so that they can be retrieved quickly by the CPU when they are required.
Why random access?
Each memory location (cell) can be accessed in any order if you know the ‘address’ of that location. This speeds up data retrieval as the CPU can go to any location and does not have to start each time at the fi rst location and go through them in order until it fi nds the correct one. That method is called ‘serial access’.
Volatile
Term used to describe memory that requires power to maintain the data stored within it
Fetch-Decode-Execute
The basic steps that a CPU carries out to process an instruction
Virtual Memory
Type of memory that combines your computers RAM with temporary space on your hard disk
Cache
"A small, high-speed type of memory that stores frequently used instructions or data"
Control Unit
Part of the CPU that co-ordinates the flow of data within the computer system
Bus
Part of a computer architecture that transfers data between different computer components
Motherboard
Central printed circuit board that holds the different computer components
Flash storage
"Memory type used by SSDs, USB drives and SD cards (derived from solid-state storage)"
Input Device
Any hardware device used to enter data into a computer system for processing
Output Device
Any hardware device used to present processed information to users
Secondary storage
Non-volatile method for storing large amounts of data for long term use
Optical
"Category of storage device which involves the use of lasers to read and write data, e.g. CD, DVD"
Magnetic
Category of storage device which includes traditional hard drives and floppy disks
Solid State
Category of storage device that does not use any moving parts
Blu-ray
A high-capacity type of optical disk pioneered by Sony for the storage of HD films and video games
Actuator
"Mechanical device that is controlled by computers, e.g. robotic arm, motor"
Sensor
"A device that can detect a physical property and records, indicates or responds to it"
CPU
Central processing unit - the brains of the computer where most calculations take place.
Heat sink
Used to cool central processing units or graphics processors.
Why are Heat Sinks needed?
The microprocessor carries out its millions of calculations per second and gets very hot. The heat sink absorbs the heat from the microprocessor before it damages it and the fan on top blows air onto it to move the heat away.
Control unit
responsible for controlling much of the operation of the rest of the processor. It does this by issuing control signals to the other areas of the processor,instructing them on what should be performed next. The decoder and the clock are elements of the control unit.
Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)
carries out mathematical and logical computations. e.g. addition, subtraction, logical test, comparisons etc
Registers
Register are memory locations within the CPU itself for storing data and instructions. They are designed to be quickly accessed for fast data retrieval.
Fetch
the program counter provides the memory address of the next instruction. This is transferred through the address bus to the memory and the instruction is transferred to the instruction register of the CPU through the data bus.
Decode
The decoder in the control unit works out what the instruction means
Execute
The control unit instructs the ALU to perform the computations required and the result is stored in one of the registers.
Program counter
This is a register in the CPU which stores the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched
Address bus
The memory address of the instruction to be fetched is transmitted from the program counter to the RAM through the address bus.
Data bus
The data is transmitted from RAM back to the instruction register in the CPU through the data bus.
Cache
A short term storage area
CPU cache and main RAM difference
CPU cache is much faster but more expensive
Why is cache used?
used to speed up certain computer operations by temporarily placing data, or a copy of it, in a location where it can be accessed more rapidly than normal. For example, data from a disk may be cached temporarily in memory so that it can be read and written more quickly than if it had to come directly from the disk itself
disk cache
a mechanism for improving the time it takes to read from or write to a hard disk drive. Can be on hard-disk or RAM. holds data that has recently been read and, in some cases, adjacent data areas that are likely to be accessed next.
memory cache
A part of RAM memory that is set aside as a specialised cache or buffer that is continually updated. used to store data eg large graphic files that are frequently read from the hard disk drive
CPU cache
used by the central processing unit of a computer to reduce the average time to access memory.
SRAM
Static RAM (makes up cache memory). Does not need to be constantly refreshed. as long as power is applied to the chip, SRAM will hold the data. It has lower latency.
Level 1 cache
is closer to the CPU than level 2 and is usually smaller in size. Usually built into the CPU
Level 2 cache
Usually resides on a separate chip next to CPU
Web cache
Folder full of webpages. If cached page has not been updated on the web, it is retrieved immediately by the browser, saving download time
Processor development obstacle
Too much heat is generated which cannot be dissipated fast enough. Transmission delays on the chip itself and between the memory and the CPU.
Multi core system
A single processor having several CPUs
Multi processor system
Several microprocessors each with a single CPU
Multi core advantage 1
Can work together on the same program
Multi core advantage 2
Can work on different programs at the same time
Why is dual core usually faster
Each CPU can process different parts of the same program simultaneously.
How much data can be saved in each memory location?
1 byte/8 bits
Parallel processing
When a CPU processes different parts of the same program simultaneously
Why dual core doesn't mean twice as quick
The tasks required to be done may not be able to be carried out in parallel. They may be sequential so that one task requires output from a previous task
Dual core
2 cores
Quad core
4 cores
Hexa core
6 cores
In what form is data saved in RAM?
